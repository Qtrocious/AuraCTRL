This is my second project and my first custom project!

Today i started to brainstorm, since highway started i created a canvas called "Pitch Ideas for Highway"

And since i wanted to make something simple but super cool.

After sometime of brainstorming ideas, I got with making a simple but super cool project, with my new experience in fusion and kicad, I got to the idea of making the LED ring that the android from DBH have on their temple, they serve the purpose of showing processing operations, damage caused, and other things.

In the robotics events (FRC) I went to, I saw a few teams that controlled the robot have some kind of wearable tech, and it ALWAYS looked cool asf.

So with that in mind i wanted to change the purpose of the led ring, when competing with other robots, scouting data from other teams robots, or just showing that you're chilling. I wanted to show a different color + be configurable with those sk6812 mini-e leds that i didn't used from hackpad!

I didn't want to worry about cables and all of that, so that's the reason i'll be shooting for making it wireless, this is a HUGE jump from me, let's hope it works lol.

After researching and getting the help of some concepts with chatgpt and deepseek (l learned about ble tech, types of esp32, mcu, the differences between micropython and circuitpython), i went with this

- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C3: For the micro controller
> So, bluetooth is out the way, because it'll require two different Xiaos, and that would cost more, so, i'll just stick with making it with wires

- The 7 SK6812 MINI-E LEDS i didn't used from the Hackpad approved parts, that will save more money!

- Also the rotary encoder from Hackpad

Time spent: 2 hours
